This is a locally ran telegram bot 'server' that i built over the summer on my raspberry pi zero 2W using the python programming language. It keeps track of personal finances in an easy-to-follow manner. Data is sent to the operating machine via a telegram bot API. Simply add the bot with the tag, '@Finance67_bot' and it will take input as seen in the images in the project directory and give necessary data in return. The version attached only provides accurate data until 25/12/25 for showcasing. Is built around a virtual environment and requires the libraries from script.py to be installed preferably locally.
