1. WAS MADE WITH A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN THIS DIRECTORY WITH PYGAME AND TKINTER INSTALLED
2. May work with pygame installed globally on windows machines


Upon opening, a basic prompt window comes up with sliders to select object masses. After selection, a countdown begins in the output terminal and yet another window comes with the simulation and object velocities in a closed, frictionless system following a ruleset of real-life collision physics. Formulae used can be seen on the image attached or funcs.py.

A video is also in the project directory incase the code is not able to be loaded.
